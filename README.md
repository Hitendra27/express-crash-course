## What Is Express.js?
Express.js, sometimes also referred to as “Express,” is a minimalist, fast, and Sinatra-like Node.js backend framework that provides robust features and tools for developing scalable backend applications. It gives you the routing system and simplified features to extend the framework by developing more powerful components and parts depending on your application use cases.

The framework provides a set of tools for web applications, HTTP requests and responses, routing, and middleware for building and deploying large-scale, enterprise-ready applications.

It also provides a command-line interface tool (CLI) called Node Package Manager (NPM), where developers can source for developed packages. It also forces developers to follow the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle.

The DRY principle is aimed at reducing the repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions, or using data normalizations to avoid redundancy.

## What Is Express.js Used For?
Express.js is used for a wide range of things in the JavaScript/Node.js ecosystem — you can develop applications, API endpoints, routing systems, and frameworks with it.

Below is a list of just a few of the types of applications you can build with Express.js.

Single-Page Applications
Single-Page Applications (SPAs) are the modern approach of application development in which the entire application is routed into a single index page. Express.js is an excellent framework for building an API that connects these SPA applications and consistently serves data. Some examples of Single Page Applications are Gmail, Google Maps, Airbnb, Netflix, Pinterest, Paypal, and many more. Companies are using SPAs to build a fluid, scalable experience.

Real-Time Collaboration Tools
Collaboration tools are here to ease the way businesses work and collaborate daily, and with Express.js, you can develop collaborative and real-time networking applications with ease.

Also, the framework is used to develop real-time applications such as chat and dashboard applications, where it becomes straightforward to integrate WebSocket into the framework.

Express.js handles the routing and middleware part of the process, allowing developers to concentrate on the vital business logic of these real-time features when developing live collaborative tools.

Streaming Applications
Real-time streaming applications like Netflix are complex and have many layers of data streams. To develop such an app, you need a solid framework to handle asynchronous data streams efficiently.

It’s an ideal framework for building and deploying enterprise-ready and scalable streaming applications.

Fintech Applications
Fintech is a computer program and other technology used to support or enable banking and financial services. Building a fintech application is currently the industry trend, and Express.js is the framework of choice for building highly scalable fintech applications.

If you’re thinking of building a fintech application with high users and transaction volume, then you’ll be joining companies such as Paypal and Capital One in developing and deploying your application using Express.js.

Why You Should Use Express.js
There are several reasons why you should consider using Express.js for your next project, from faster I/O for faster requests and responses to its single-thread system and asynchronous processes. It also uses the MVC structure to simplify data manipulations and routing systems.

Let’s take a closer look at some of the main reasons you should consider using Express.js.

Flexible and Speedy
Express.js is very easy-to-use and flexible, and it’s faster than any other Node.js framework. A minimalistic framework, it offers rapid application development and eases the stress of mastering the many different parts of a larger framework. It also provides rich features such as an excellent routing system, middlewares, and content negotiation right out of the box.

Part of the MEAN Stack
Express.js is the framework of choice in each stack represented with the E in any stacks, such as MERN, MEAN, and so forth. It can also easily be integrated into any stack or technology to show how vital the framework is in the MEAN stack development process.

What’s more, it can connect efficiently with a more robust database management system than the conventional MySQL and provides a seamless development process across each stack. This combination of features makes Express.js very popular among MEAN developers.

Scalability
Express.js has proven to be very scalable over the years because of the number of large companies using the framework on their server daily.

It handles user requests and responses efficiently and requires little to no extra configuration when developing a large-scale web application.

It has excellent modules, packages, and additional resources, which helps developers to create reliable and scalable web applications.

Supported by Google V8 Engine
Express.js supports many Google V8 engine packages, making the framework very powerful for building and deploying real-time, collaborative, and network-based applications at an enterprise level.

Google V8 engine is an open-source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine that supports high speed and scalability for complex and intense applications. When you use packages that use the Google V8 engine, it’s a massive performance and scalability boost to your backend application.

Community Support
Since the framework is the most popular Node.js backend framework, it has the highest number of community support, resources, and packages for any development challenges. The support from Google is also extensive, which makes the framework a popular choice amongst Node.js developers. Its open-sourced nature gives developers the opportunity to create extensible packages and resources to ease development, not just for themselves, but for all others who code with Express.js.
